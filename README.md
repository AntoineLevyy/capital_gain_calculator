# if_only
If only I had invested...

This is a simple notebook that shows capital gains on a stock between two points in time. NB: This only calculates capital gains. #TODO: Add dividend payouts.

Instructions: Replace symbol, entry_date, exit_date and investment. This example shows the capital gains for an investment of 1000USD in NVDA between "2010-08-31" and "2023-09-15". (You will also need to replace key with your own AlphaVantage API Key)

## Library and API
- AlphaVantage API provides the data.
- Matplotlib is used to plot the time series of the stock's daily close prices.

# How much?

This is a simple notebook that shows capital gains on a stock between two points in time. NB: This only calculates capital gains. #TODO: Add dividend payouts.

Instructions: Replace symbol, entry_date, exit_date and investment. This example shows the capital gains for an investment of 10,000USD in NVDA between "2023-06-06" and "2023-09-15". (You will also need to replace key with your own AlphaVantage API Key)
